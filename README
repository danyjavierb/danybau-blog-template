danybau wordpress template

Hi, i forked this code from an old template that i used since a time ago, but in this time i created an cool design template, now i am Html5fying the template, but if you wanna try by your self is a cool idea.

This template works as all the wordpress templates, but for code highlighting i recommend the Syntax-highlighter++ plugin.

For this template i wrote a code that encapsules several twitter search routines using jquery.

Thanks.
